let sum = 5 + 3; //* Result: 8
let difference = 10 - 4; //* Result: 6
let product = 3 * 7; //* Result: 21
let quotient = 15 / 3; //* Result: 5
let remainder = 17 % 5; //* Result: 2 (because 17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2)

let count = 10;
count++; //* Now count is 11

let total = 20;
total--; //* Now total is 19

let result = 2 ** 3; //* Result: 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
