//! Objects are used to store data in key value pairs 

const object = {
    key1 : "value1",
    key2 : "value2",
}































//! Important 
//? Objects created with initializers are called plain objects
const newObj = object.create()
const obj = new object()
//? these are initializers
//? but they are used in old versions of js



//! Objects are Mutable
//? you can modify their properties or elements without creating a new object
